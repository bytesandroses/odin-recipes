      <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Beef:
        <ul>
          <li>Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Sear the beef on all sides until browned. Remove from heat and let it cool. Brush the beef with Dijon mustard.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Prepare the Mushroom Duxelles:
        <ul>
          <li>In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add chopped mushrooms and garlic. Cook until the mushrooms release their moisture and the mixture becomes dry.</li>
          <li>Season with salt and pepper, add white wine, and cook until the wine evaporates.</li>
          <li>Stir in chopped parsley, then let the mushroom mixture cool.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Assemble the Wellington:
        <ul>
          <li>Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap and arrange the prosciutto slices on it, slightly overlapping.</li>
          <li>Spread the mushroom duxelles over the prosciutto.</li>
          <li>Place the beef on top and roll it up tightly using the plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Roll Out the Pastry:
        <ul>
          <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a size that can completely wrap the beef.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Assemble and Bake:
        <ul>
          <li>Unwrap the beef from the prosciutto and place it in the center of the pastry.</li>
          <li>Fold the pastry over the beef and seal the edges. Brush the pastry with the egg wash.</li>
          <li>Place the wrapped beef on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rest and Serve:
        <ul>
          <li>Allow the Beef Wellington to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
          <li>Serve slices with your favorite sauce, such as a red wine reduction or a mushroom sauce.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
