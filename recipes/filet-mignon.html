    <h1>Filet Mignon</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Filet mignon is a popular and highly prized cut of beef that comes from the smaller end of the tenderloin, which is a long, cylindrical muscle running along the spine of the cow. This particular cut is known for its tenderness and lean, buttery texture. It is often considered one of the most tender cuts of beef.
    </p>
    <p>Filet mignon is considered a premium cut of beef and is typically more expensive than other cuts due to its tenderness and desirability. While some steak enthusiasts may prefer cuts with more marbling for a richer flavor, filet mignon remains a favorite for those who prioritize tenderness and a leaner profile in their beef.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 filet mignon steaks (about 1.5 inches thick)</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Optional: Fresh herbs (rosemary or thyme) for added flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring Steaks to Room Temperature:
        <ul>
          <li>Remove the filet mignon from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30-60 minutes. This helps ensure even cooking.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Preheat Oven:
        <ul>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Season the Steaks:
        <ul>
          <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and black pepper. Optionally, you can add finely chopped fresh herbs for extra flavor.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Heat the Pan:
        <ul>
          <li>Heat a heavy, oven-safe skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and let it get hot but not smoking.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sear the Steaks:
        <ul>
          <li>Place the filet mignon in the hot pan. Sear for 2-3 minutes on one side without moving them to achieve a nice crust. Flip and sear for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add Butter and Finish in the Oven:
        <ul>
          <li>Add butter to the pan. Once melted, baste the steaks with the melted butter using a spoon. Transfer the pan to the preheated oven to finish cooking. For medium-rare, cook for about 5-7 minutes in the oven. Adjust the time for your desired level of doneness.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rest the Steaks:
        <ul>
          <li>Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the steaks to a plate. Allow them to rest for at least 5 minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a juicy steak.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Serve:
        <ul>
          <li>Slice the filet mignon against the grain and serve. You can drizzle any pan juices over the steaks for added flavor.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your deliciously seared filet mignon!</p>
