    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chili con carne, often simply referred to as "chili," is a hearty and flavorful stew that originated in Texas but has become popular throughout the United States and beyond. The name "chili con carne" is Spanish and translates to "chili with meat."</p>
    <p>Chili is typically cooked low and slow, allowing the flavors to meld and the meat to become tender. It's a versatile dish often served with various toppings, such as shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped green onions, or cilantro.</p>
    <p>Chili con carne is enjoyed on its own, over rice, or with accompaniments like cornbread. It's a comfort food that is perfect for gatherings, game days, or a satisfying meal on a chilly day.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics:
          <ul>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until softened. Add minced garlic and jalapeños, sautéing for another minute.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Brown Ground Beef:
          <ul>
            <li>Add the ground beef to the pot, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook until browned, stirring occasionally to crumble the meat.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add Spices:
          <ul>
            <li>Sprinkle chili powder, ground cumin, dried oregano, paprika, salt, and black pepper over the meat. Stir well to coat the meat and aromatics with the spices.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Combine Ingredients:
          <ul>
            <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and beef broth. Stir to combine. Add the drained and rinsed kidney beans.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Simmer:
          <ul>
            <li>Bring the chili to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. You can simmer longer for a richer flavor.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Adjust Seasoning:
          <ul>

        <li>Serve:
          <ul>
            <li>Ladle the chili into bowls and serve hot. Top with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, chopped green onions, or cilantro, if desired.</li>
